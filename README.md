# Mircomouse Power Board Design
### Produced by: Rafael Cardoso and Amir Dollie 

This repository serves to hold and offer version control for the mircomouse power board designed.

**IMPORTANT:** since KiCAD, which was used to produce the necessary production files for submission to JLCPCB, does not allow easy merging capabilities for simultaneous development the following file strcuture was used:<br><br>

- Final Project Workfolder contains the final submission schematic and PCB: Final Project Workfolder -> Final
        (The other files in this section are for previous revision submissions and also contain images of JLCPCB quotes...etc)
- Raf'sWorkspace/MMPOwerBoardKiCAD9Version contains the most recent (current) schematic and pcb file for the entire PCB board.
- SchematicLibrary contains the files of all custom and imported symbols and footprints associated with the design.
